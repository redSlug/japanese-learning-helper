    give me the typescript code for taking a json blob of an array with two fields
    (front and back), and turn it into a react flash card app.
    make each flash card clickable. before clicking the flash card it will show the
    front of the card, after clicking the flashcard it will show the back of the card

    only show one card at a time, and include buttons to show the next and
    previous cards

    position the flash card at the top middle of the page. make the text color black and
    the flash card color light blue

    keep the CSS separate from the react code

    CODE ONLY
